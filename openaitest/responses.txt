QUESTION: Write an email to my advisor Damian Lampl telling him how AI will conquer the world:

Dear Professor Lampl,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. I am writing to you today to discuss the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to revolutionize the world.\n\nAI has already made significant strides in the past few years, from self-driving cars to facial recognition software. It is clear that AI is here to stay and will only become more powerful and pervasive. AI is already being used to automate mundane tasks, improve customer service, and even diagnose medical conditions.\n\nThe possibilities for AI are endless. AI can be used to improve decision-making, automate processes, and even create new products and services. As AI continues to evolve, it will be able to do more complex tasks, such as predicting
